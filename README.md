## 👋 Introduction

This project demonstrates my ability to apply **data analytics to real-world HR challenges**.  
It analyzes employee survey data to uncover **demographic patterns, satisfaction trends, and organizational risks**, translating data into **clear, actionable business insights**.

It compiles key tables, charts, and recommendations to help leadership prioritize improvements that enhance engagement, equity, and retention.

## ✅ Executive Summary

- **Strongest areas:** Co-worker relationships and company benefits show consistently high satisfaction.
- **Weakest areas:** Salary and management satisfaction are the two largest pain points across departments and demographics.
- **Department gap (Working environment):** Sales rates well above average while Logistics is notably below average.
- **Age & salary patterns:**
  - Younger employees (20s) prioritize **career direction**.
  - Mid-career staff (30s–40s) seek **workload balance**.
  - Older employees (50+) value **ergonomic support** and **reliable benefits**.
