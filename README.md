## 👋 Introduction

This project demonstrates my ability to apply **data analytics to real-world HR challenges**.  
It analyzes employee survey data to uncover **demographic patterns, satisfaction trends, and organizational risks**, translating data into **clear, actionable business insights**.

It compiles key tables, charts, and recommendations to help leadership prioritize improvements that enhance engagement, equity, and retention.

## ✅ Executive Summary

- **Strongest areas:** Co-worker relationships and company benefits show consistently high satisfaction.
- **Weakest areas:** Salary and management satisfaction are the two largest pain points across departments and demographics.
- **Department gap (Working environment):** Sales rates well above average while Logistics is notably below average.
- **Age & salary patterns:**
  - Younger employees (20s) prioritize **career direction**.
  - Mid-career staff (30s–40s) seek **workload balance**.
  - Older employees (50+) value **ergonomic support** and **reliable benefits**.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Organizations often collect employee survey data but fail to convert it into **actionable insights**.  
This project answers key HR questions such as:

- What factors drive employee dissatisfaction?
- How do satisfaction levels differ by department, age, salary, and education?
- Where should leadership prioritize interventions to improve engagement and retention?

## 🎯 Objectives

- Examine workforce demographics (gender, age, education, department, salary).
- Measure employee satisfaction across key organizational factors.
- Identify disparities between demographic and departmental groups.
- Deliver data-driven recommendations to improve engagement, equity, and retention

## 🔬 Methodology & Analytical Approach

This document explains the analytical methodology used in the *Employee Survey Analytics Project*.  
It is designed for transparency, reproducibility, and recruiter review.

### Data Collection

- Internal employee survey (fictional)
- Cross-sectional dataset
- Anonymized responses

### Measurement Scale

All satisfaction variables use a **5-point Likert scale**:

1. Highly Unsatisfied  
2. Unsatisfied  
3. Neutral  
4. Satisfied  
5. Highly Satisfied

### Analytical Techniques

#### 1. Descriptive

- Mean
- Median
- Standard deviation
- Minimum and maximum values
- Percentage

Used to understand central tendencies and variability in satisfaction scores.

#### 2. Group

Comparisons were conducted across:

- Department
- Age category
- Salary category
- Education level
- Gender
  
- Comparison details
  - **Education by Department:** Laboratory and Sales skew toward higher academic qualifications; Logistics is more practice-oriented.
  - **Salary vs. Education:** Higher education correlates with higher salary brackets across the board.
  - **Salary vs. Gender:** Men are over-represented in >€4,500 bracket despite smaller share of workforce; women concentrated in lower/mid bands.
  - **Age distribution by Department:** Logistics has the largest share of 50+ employees; Laboratory and Sales are more balanced.

This allowed identification of structural and demographic differences.

#### 3. Cross-Tabulation

- Salary vs Education
- Salary vs Gender
- Education vs Department
- Age vs Department

Used to detect patterns and potential inequities.

#### 4. Visual Analytics

- Bar charts
- Distribution charts
- Comparative plots

Visuals were used to highlight gaps and trends clearly for stakeholders.

### Analytical Focus

Rather than advanced predictive modeling, the analysis prioritized:

- Interpretability
- Actionability
- Business relevance
- HR decision support

### 😊 Satisfaction Metrics (1–5 scale)

Overall means:

- **Management:** 2.54 (median 2.0) — lowest area.
- **Co-workers:** 3.72 (median 4.0) — highest area.
- **Working environment:** 2.89.
- **Salary:** 2.31 — widespread dissatisfaction.
- **Work tasks:** 2.68.
- **Company benefits:** 3.36.
- **Career development:** 3.03.

#### Differences by Group

- **Department:** Sales has the highest working environment score (~4.04); Logistics the lowest (~2.05). Salary satisfaction is low everywhere (≈2.12–2.41).
- **Age:** Younger staff rate co-workers highest but are least satisfied with salary; older staff (50+) find tasks more fulfilling but show lower career development scores.
- **Salary Category:** Higher salary correlates with better environment/benefit/task satisfaction, but **management** satisfaction remains low across all bands.
- **Gender:** Largest gap appears in **salary satisfaction** (female ≈2.55 vs. male ≈1.85); co-worker satisfaction is high for all. *(Note: “Other” group results are impacted by very small n).*
